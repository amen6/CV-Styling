              The CS50 introduction to computer science course was beneficial for me as a beginner, it gave me a better idea about programming and computers, helped me to think more algorithmically, and can understand the code better now. The videos were fun to watch, and also very useful. Starting with C was hard for me, some problems were hard to solve, but in the end, I was able to solve them. Python was really interesting, it was easier to understand than C, I have redone the C problem sets but using Python. As a self-taught learner, it gave me the opportunity to learn how to search for the problems facing me, read documentation, and learn things from different places, I learned how to use libraries too. I used HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask in the final project <b>(finance)</b>, it was an excellent experience to build a project on my own. The CS50 was a bit hard as my first course, but in the end, it paid off.

              The Odin Project (also known as TOP) is an open source community and curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Students of The Odin Project build portfolio projects and complete lessons that are constantly curated and updated with links to relevant resources. Odin isn't easy ofcourse, did i enjoyed it? probably anyone interested in programming will, is it beneficial? no doubt, you will be able to see yourself developping by time. There will be many times that you will get stuck and may question your ability to learn programming, but with persistence you'll get it.
